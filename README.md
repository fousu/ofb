# OFB

****

This is a [travel application](http://www.uaeexchangetravel.com/), which demonstrates [Microservice Architecture Pattern] using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud and Docker.
With a pretty neat user interface, by the way.



## Functional services

ofb was decomposed into three core microservices. All of them are independently deployable applications, organized around certain business domains.

#### Customer service
Contains general customer input logic and validation: customer signup and sigin.




Method	| Path	| Description	| User authenticated	|
------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |:-------------:|
GET	| /customer/login/	| Get specified airline fare	          | 	
POST	| /customer/register/	| Get current account statistics	| × |

#### Flight search services
Contains general user input logic and validation: search with preferred airline.
Flight search service is decomposes into four miceoservices.which will call the different airline providers.

Method	| Path	| Description	| User authenticated	| Available from UI
------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |:-------------:|:----------------:|
GET	| /flightSearch/{airline}	| Get specified airline fare	          |  | 	



#### Flight book and ticket services
Performs calculations on major statistics parameters and captures time series for each account. Datapoint contains values, normalized to base currency and time period. This data is used to track cash flow dynamics in account lifetime.

POST	| /flightBook/{airline}	| Get specified account statistics	          |  | 	



#### Notes
- Each microservice has it's own database connection, so there is no way to bypass API and access persistance data directly.
- In this project, I use Mysql as a primary database for each service. It might also make sense to have a polyglot persistence architecture (сhoose the type of db that is best suited to service requirements).
- Service-to-service communication is quite simplified: microservices talking using only synchronous REST API. Common practice in a real-world systems is to use combination of interaction styles. For example, perform synchronous GET request to retrieve data and use asynchronous approach via Message broker for create/update operations in order to decouple services and buffer messages. However, this brings us to the [eventual consistency](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#consistency) world.

## Infrastructure services
There's a bunch of common patterns in distributed systems, which could help us to make described core services work. [Spring cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) provides powerful tools that enhance Spring Boot applications behaviour to implement those patterns. I'll cover them briefly.
<img width="880" alt="Infrastructure services" src="https://github.com/fousu/ofb/blob/master/arch%20.png">
### Config service
[Spring Cloud Config](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html) is horizontally scalable centralized configuration service for distributed systems. It uses a pluggable repository layer that currently supports local storage, Git. 





### Auth service
Authorization responsibilities are completely extracted to separate server, which grants [OAuth2 tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for the backend resource services. Auth Server is used for user authorization as well as for secure machine-to-machine communication inside a perimeter.


Oauth2 is the preferred method of authenticating access to the API. Oauth2 allows authorization with clients id and cliet secret . clients gets a token that authorizes access to the user's account.

<img width="880" alt="Auth services" src="https://github.com/fousu/ofb/blob/master/token.PNG">

### Swagger API
Swagger is the largest framework for designing APIs using a common language and enabling the development across the whole API lifecycle, including documentation, design, testing, and deployment.

<img width="880" alt="Swagger APIs" src="https://github.com/fousu/ofb/blob/master/swagger-api2.PNG">

### API Gateway
As you can see, there are three core services, which expose external API to client. In a real-world systems, this number can grow very quickly as well as whole system complexity. Actually, hundreds of services might be involved in rendering of one complex webpage.

In theory, a client could make requests to each of the microservices directly. But obviously, there are challenges and limitations with this option, like necessity to know all endpoints addresses, perform http request for each peace of information separately, merge the result on a client side. Another problem is non web-friendly protocols which might be used on the backend.

Usually a much better approach is to use API Gateway. It is a single entry point into the system, used to handle requests by routing them to the appropriate backend service or by invoking multiple backend services and [aggregating the results](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/optimizing-netflix-api.html). Also, it can be used for authentication, insights, stress and canary testing, service migration, static response handling, active traffic management.

Netflix opensourced [such an edge service](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/announcing-zuul-edge-service-in-cloud.html), and now with Spring Cloud we can enable it with one `@EnableZuulProxy` annotation.


### Service discovery

Another commonly known architecture pattern is Service discovery. It allows automatic detection of network locations for service instances, which could have dynamically assigned addresses because of auto-scaling, failures and upgrades.

The key part of Service discovery is Registry. Eureka is a good example of the client-side discovery pattern, when client is responsible for determining locations of available service instances (using Registry server) and load balancing requests across them.

With Spring Boot, you can easily build Eureka Registry with `spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server` dependency, `@EnableEurekaServer` annotation and simple configuration properties.


Now, on application startup, it will register with Eureka Server and provide meta-data, such as host and port, health indicator URL, home page etc. Eureka receives heartbeat messages from each instance belonging to a service. If the heartbeat fails over a configurable timetable, the instance will be removed from the registry.

Also, Eureka provides a simple interface, where you can track running services and a number of available instances.

### Load balancer, Circuit breaker and Http client

Netflix OSS provides another great set of tools. 

#### Ribbon
Ribbon is a client side load balancer which gives you a lot of control over the behaviour of HTTP and TCP clients. Compared to a traditional load balancer, there is no need in additional hop for every over-the-wire invocation - you can contact desired service directly.

Out of the box, it natively integrates with Spring Cloud and Service Discovery. [Eureka Client] provides a dynamic list of available servers so Ribbon could balance between them.

#### Hystrix
Hystrix is the implementation of [Circuit Breaker pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html), which gives a control over latency and failure from dependencies accessed over the network. The main idea is to stop cascading failures in a distributed environment with a large number of microservices. That helps to fail fast and recover as soon as possible - important aspects of fault-tolerant systems that self-heal.

Besides circuit breaker control, with Hystrix you can add a fallback method that will be called to obtain a default value in case the main command fails.

Moreover, Hystrix generates metrics on execution outcomes and latency for each command, that we can use to [monitor system behavior]

#### Feign
Feign is a declarative Http client, which seamlessly integrates with Ribbon and Hystrix. Actually, with one `spring-cloud-starter-feign` dependency and `@EnableFeignClients` annotation you have a full set of Load balancer, Circuit breaker and Http client with sensible ready-to-go default configuration.

- Everything you need is just an interface
- You can share `@RequestMapping` part between Spring MVC controller and Feign methods
- Above example specifies just desired service id - `statistics-service`, thanks to autodiscovery through Eureka (but obviously you can access any resource with a specific url)

### Monitor dashboard

In this project configuration, each microservice with Hystrix on board pushes metrics to Turbine via Spring Cloud Bus (with AMQP broker). The Monitoring project is just a small Spring boot application with [Turbine](https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine) and [Hystrix Dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard).


Let's see our system behavior under load: Account service calls Statistics service and it responses with a vary imitation delay. Response timeout threshold is set to 1 second.

<img width="212" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6069066/14127349/21e90026-f628-11e5-83f1-60108cb33490.gif">	| <img width="212" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6069066/14127348/21e6ed40-f628-11e5-9fa4-ed527bf35129.gif"> | <img width="212" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6069066/14127346/21b9aaa6-f628-11e5-9bba-aaccab60fd69.gif"> | <img width="212" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6069066/14127350/21eafe1c-f628-11e5-8ccd-a6b6873c046a.gif">
--- |--- |--- |--- |
| `0 ms delay` | `500 ms delay` | `800 ms delay` | `1100 ms delay`
| Well behaving system. The throughput is about 22 requests/second. Small number of active threads in Statistics service. The median service time is about 50 ms. | The number of active threads is growing. We can see purple number of thread-pool rejections and therefore about 30-40% of errors, but circuit is still closed. | Half-open state: the ratio of failed commands is more than 50%, the circuit breaker kicks in. After sleep window amount of time, the next request is let through. | 100 percent of the requests fail. The circuit is now permanently open. Retry after sleep time won't close circuit again, because the single request is too slow.

### Log analysis

Centralized logging can be very useful when attempting to identify problems in a distributed environment. Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana stack lets you search and analyze your logs, utilization and network activity data with ease.

### Distributed tracing

Analyzing problems in distributed systems can be difficult, for example, tracing requests that propagate from one microservice to another. It can be quite a challenge to try to find out how a request travels through the system, especially if you don't have any insight into the implementation of a microservice. Even when there is logging, it is hard to tell which action correlates to a single request.

[Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/) solves this problem by providing support for distributed tracing. It adds two types of IDs to the logging: traceId and spanId. The spanId represents a basic unit of work, for example sending an HTTP request. The traceId contains a set of spans forming a tree-like structure. For example, with a distributed big-data store, a trace might be formed by a PUT request. Using traceId and spanId for each operation we know when and where our application is as it processes a request, making reading our logs much easier. 



## Security

An advanced security configuration is beyond the scope of this proof-of-concept project. For a more realistic simulation of a real system, consider to use https, JCE keystore to encrypt Microservices passwords and Config server properties content (see [documentation](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_security) for details).

## Infrastructure automation

Deploying microservices, with their interdependence, is much more complex process than deploying monolithic application. It is important to have fully automated infrastructure. We can achieve following benefits with Continuous Delivery approach:

- The ability to release software anytime
- Any build could end up being a release
- Build artifacts once - deploy as needed

Here is a simple Continuous Delivery workflow, implemented in this project:

## How to run all the things?

Keep in mind, that you are going to start 8 Spring Boot applications, 4 MongoDB instances and RabbitMq. Make sure you have `4 Gb` RAM available on your machine. You can always run just vital services though: Gateway, Registry, Config, Auth Service and Account Service.
